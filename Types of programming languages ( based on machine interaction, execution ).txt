Programming languages

What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a formal system used to write instructions that a computer can execute, bridging human logic and machine operations.

Types of Programming Languages

1- Low-Level Languages

- Directly interact with hardware; difficult to understand.

Example: Assembly, Machine Code.

2- High-Level Languages

- Easier for humans to read and write.

Example: C, Java, Python, C#.

3- Compiled Languages

- Entire code is compiled into machine code before execution.

Example: C, C++, Rust.

4- Interpreted Languages

- Code is executed line-by-line during runtime.

Example: Python, JavaScript.

5- Hybrid Languages

- First compiled into intermediate code, then interpreted at runtime.

Example: C#, Java.

6- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Code is structured using classes and objects.

Example: C#, Java, Python.

7- Functional Programming 

- Focuses on pure functions and immutability.

Example: Haskell, Lisp, JavaScript.


C# - A Hybrid Language

- C# combines both compiled and interpreted approaches using:

- Compilation: C# code is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL).

-  Interpretation: At runtime, the CLR (Common Language Runtime) interprets and compiles IL into machine code using JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

- An IDE provides tools to write, debug, and deploy code more efficiently.

Example: Visual Studio is commonly used for C# development.
