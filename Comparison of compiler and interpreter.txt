Comparison of compiler and interpreter

1. Execution Approach

- Compiler: Converts the entire program into machine code before execution.

- Interpreter: Translates and executes code line-by-line at runtime.

2. Speed

- Compiler: Faster execution (since code is pre-compiled).

- Interpreter: Slower (due to real-time translation).

3. Debugging

- Compiler: Shows errors after compilation (harder to debug).

- Interpreter: Stops and shows errors immediately (easier debugging).

4. Memory Usage

 - Compiler: Requires more memory (stores machine code).

- Interpreter: Uses less memory (no intermediate code).

5. Portability

- Compiler: Generates machine-dependent executables (less portable).

- Interpreter: Runs anywhere with an interpreter (more portable).

6. Error Handling

- Compiler: Reports all errors at once after compilation.

- Interpreter: Stops at the first error encountered.

7. Distribution

- Compiler: Distributes executable files (binary).

- Interpreter: Distributes source code directly.

8. Examples

- Compiler: C, C++, Go, Rust.

- Interpreter: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

9. Best Use Cases

- Compiler: High-performance applications (games, OS, system software).

- Interpreter: Scripting, rapid development, and dynamic languages.
