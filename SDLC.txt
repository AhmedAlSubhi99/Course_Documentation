Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)

Software Development Life Cycle provides a practical framework you can apply to your product and improve your processes. It helps us meet customers’ demands, needs, and expectations. You can outline and define a detailed plan for stages, phases, and requirements with SDLC. It covers planning, estimating, and scheduling.

Phases:

1- Analysis phase:

Critical phase within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where detailed requirements are gathered and analyzed to ensure a clear understanding of the project’s scope and objectives.

Defines functional and non-functional requirements.

Establishes clear specifications for the system.

Gather and document user expectations.

Input:

Customer requirements
Business needs

Output:

Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
User stories and use case diagrams

2- Design phase: 

Design phase is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software's functionality and aesthetic. This ultimately results in the software product. The emphasis lies on outlining the software's structure, navigation, user interfaces, and database design. This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently.

User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design Design the user interface to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience. Consider usability, accessibility, and visual aesthetics in the design process.

Translates requirements into a blueprint for implementation.

Create the software’s architecture and user interfaces.

Input:

SRS document

Output:

System design documents
Database schema
Wireframes and UI mockups

3- Development phase:

The development stage is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications. In general, Its write the code.

Converts design into actual software using programming languages.

Two types:

1-Front-end Developer: someone who creates websites and web applications.

2-Back-end Developer: working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website.

Input:

Design documents

Output:

Source code
Executable software

4- Testing phase:

the testing is done to ensure that the entire application works according to the customer requirements. After testing, the QA and testing team might find some bugs or defects and communicate the same with the developers.

Assemble the modules in a testing environment. Check for errors, bugs, and interoperability.

Ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.

Input:

Source code
Test cases

Output:

Test reports
Bug reports

5- Deployment phase:

Delivers the final product to the customer in a live production environment.

Deploy the software in a production environment.

Makes the software available to end users.

Input:

Tested software

Output:

Live production software

6- Maintenance phase:

an essential component that ensures continued software functionality, handles vital repairs and updates, and ensures that the software remains relevant and usable. Also, handles enhancements and user support.

Used for: 
Fix bugs
Update features
Optimize performance

Input:

Feedback from users
Bug reports

Output:

Updated versions of software
Performance reports
