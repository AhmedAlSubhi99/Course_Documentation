Algorithm programming components 


Algorithm programming involves designing step-by-step solutions to solve computational problems. Here are the fundamental components:

1. Input

- The data or values provided to the algorithm for processing.

Example: An array of numbers to be sorted.

int age = 25;
double price = 19.99;
string name = "Alice";


2. Output

- The result produced after executing the algorithm.

Example: A sorted array.


3. Operations & Computations

- The logical steps and calculations performed on the input.

Example: Addition, subtraction, comparisons, loops.

                          int AddNumbers(int a, int b) 
                          {
                               return a + b;
                          }


4. Control Structures

- Sequential Execution: Instructions execute one after another.

Conditional Statements (if, switch): Decision-making processes.

Loops (for, while): Repeating a block of code based on a condition.

// If-else

                          if (age >= 18) 
                         {
                            Console.WriteLine("Adult");
                         }

// For loop

                          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
                          {
                               Console.WriteLine(i);
                          }


5. Data Structures

- Organizing data efficiently for processing.

Example: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs.

                    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                    List<string> names = new List<string>();
