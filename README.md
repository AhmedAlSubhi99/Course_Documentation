## What is Agile Methodology?

Agile is a flexible, iterative, and collaborative approach to software development that focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements instead of a big final release. It helps teams respond quickly to changing requirements and continuously improve their software based on feedback.

## Purposes of Agile

- Deliver Value Faster: Instead of waiting months for a full product, Agile delivers small, usable features quickly.
- Adapt to Changes: Agile allows teams to adjust project goals based on customer feedback and market trends.
- Improve Collaboration: Encourages continuous communication between developers, testers, product owners, and stakeholders.
- Ensure High Quality: Frequent testing and feedback help catch bugs early, reducing costly fixes later.
- Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Customers see progress frequently and get a product that meets their real needs.

## What is waterfall?

The waterfall project management method is a linear, step-by-step approach that's ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable timeline. It involves rigorous planning upfront to ensure that the project stays on track, with progress tracked closely and issues addressed promptly. The Waterfall model usually includes five project management stages (or phases): initiation, planning, execution, monitoring/control, and closing.

## What is agile?

Agile project management is a flexible and iterative approach that enables teams to quickly adapt to changing project requirements and deliver high-quality results within shorter timeframes. It’s very often used in software development.

Agile methodologies are about teamwork, customer satisfaction, constant refinement, and breaking big projects into bite-sized pieces. By prioritizing collaboration and communication, agile processes enable teams to pivot and respond to evolving customer needs while maintaining a high level of flexibility. The focus on continuous improvement means that teams are always seeking ways to optimize their processes and deliver the best possible results.

### Agile Model Advantages

1- Faster Delivery: Continuous releases provide early software versions.
2- Flexibility & Adaptability: Can change requirements mid-project.
3- Customer Satisfaction: Frequent feedback ensures alignment with business needs.

### Agile Model Disadvantages

1- Requires High Customer Involvement: Needs active participation from stakeholders.
2- Difficult to Estimate Time & Cost: Since requirements evolve, budgets and timelines can shift.
3- Not Ideal for Fixed-Scope Projects: Unnecessary complexity for well-defined requirements.

### Waterfall Model Advantages

1- Clear Structure: Well-defined phases make planning straightforward.
3- Well-Documented Process: Helps in future maintenance and compliance-heavy industries.
4- Easier to Manage: Defined stages and deliverables make tracking simpler.

### Waterfall Model Disadvantages

1- Hard to Accommodate Changes: Once a phase is completed, it's difficult to go back.
2- Late Testing & Bug Fixing: Issues found late are costly to fix.
3- Higher Risk of Failure: If requirements were misunderstood, major problems arise late in the process.
4- Customer Feedback is Limited: Customers only see the product at the end.
