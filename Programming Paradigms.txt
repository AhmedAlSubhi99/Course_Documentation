Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language.

Types of Programming Paradigms:

1. Imperative programming paradigm

- It is one of the oldest programming paradigm.
- It features close relation to machine architecture. 
- It is based on Von Neumann architecture. 
- It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. 
- It performs step by step task by changing state. 

Advantages: 

1- Very simple to implement
2- It contains loops, variables etc.

Disadvantage:  

1- Complex problem cannot be solved.
2- Less efficient and less productive.
3- Parallel programming is not possible.

2. Declarative programming paradigm: 

- It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. 
- In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. 
- It often considers programs as theories of some logic.
- It may simplify writing parallel programs.

Advantages:

1- Short, efficient code.
2- Can be implemented using methods not yet known at the time of programming.

Disadvantages:

1- Sometimes hard to understand for external people.
2- Based on an unfamiliar conceptual model for people (solution state).
