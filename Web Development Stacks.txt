Web Development Stacks

Front-End Developer

A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

Client-side rendering

a technique for rendering web content on the client-side.
The client requests a minimal HTML file from the server which contains the necessary JavaScript and CSS files.

Server-side rendering

a technique where a server generates the complete HTML for a webpage upfront, sending it ready for immediate display by a web browser.
Server-side rendering can be more complex and costly to implement than client-side rendering.

 Blazor

  a web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript.

Angular

a development platform, built on TypeScript.

As a platform, Angular includes:

A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication.
A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.

Next.js

an open-source web development framework created by the private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static rendering.

HTML

Stand for HyperText Markup Language.
The code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

Web API

an application processing interface between a web server and web browser. All web services are APIs but not all APIs are web services. REST API is a special type of Web API that uses the standard architectural style.

Back-end Developer

Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website.

C#

a general-purpose language that uses static typing, component-oriented structure, and employs multiple paradigms.

NET framework
 
a powerful and versatile tool for web development.

ORM

Object-Relational Mapping is a technique that allows developers to manipulate database data as if they were working with objects in their programming language.

Entity Framework (EF)

an object-relational mapper that enables . NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects.

Database

a storing system that collects organized data, to make some works easier like searching, structure, and extend.

SQL Server

ideal for storing all the desired information in relational databases, as well as to manage such data without complications.
